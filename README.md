Memtreemap is a Firefox add-on for visualizing how loaded pages and some Firefox internals are using your memory.

Load it by clicking the widget on the add-on bar, or Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Y

This visualization focuses on how loaded web pages are using memory. This doesn't yet show how much is being used by some of the Firefox internals. Maybe I'll introduce a global view at some point.
